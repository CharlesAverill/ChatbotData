# ChatbotData
This git contains data files required to run Jishnu Chowdhury's [Chatbot](https://github.com/JRC1995/Chatbot). 
The [Jupyter Notebook](https://github.com/CharlesAverill/ChatbotData/blob/master/Chatbot.ipynb) was written for Colab, but
it should run fine on an Ubuntu machine, just cd to a directory named "content" before you run the notebook.
